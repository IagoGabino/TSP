# Traveling Salesman Problem
Euclidean TSP - BnB, Approximation Algorithms\
Algorithms 2 - 2023/2 - UFMG


# Running the code
To run the approximation algorithms, go to [```src```](src/)
folder and execute ```python3 run.py```. The results will be saved in the ```results_approx.txt``` file.

You can also open and run the notebook ```comparison.ipynb``` in [```src```](src/) folder to see the comparison of the approximation algorithms.

To run the branch and bound algorithm, go to [```src```](src/) folder and execute ```python3 bnb.py```. The results will be saved in the ```results_bnb.txt``` file.
